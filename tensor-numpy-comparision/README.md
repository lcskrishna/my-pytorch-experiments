## Notes on comparision and similarities of numpy and pytorch tensors

* Tensor is identical to numpy array.
* Pytorch tensor is implemented to speedup the operations either on GPU or CPU.
* In the above examples, numpy_test.py takes 9seconds for 500 iterations and pytorch_tensor_test.py takes 1.5 seconds for training.
